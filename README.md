# Stoch_Opt_-Reforestation
In this project, we developed a stochastic optimization model to enhance species distribution in Mexican reforestation efforts, for the National Forestry Commission of Mexico (CONAFOR). Our model aimed to minimize interspecies competition and maximize survival rates by leveraging advanced stochastic techniques.
