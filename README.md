# Stoch_Opt_Reforestation
In this project, we developed a stochastic optimization model to enhance species distribution in Mexican reforestation efforts, for the National Forestry Commission of Mexico (CONAFOR). Our model aimed to minimize interspecies competition and maximize survival rates by leveraging advanced stochastic techniques.

We employed Monte Carlo simulations to estimate the expected number of plants and their survival rates based on historical data. A Markov chain model was used to simulate the transitions between species over time, incorporating probabilistic interactions. Our optimization problem focused on minimizing competition between species, represented by a competition matrix, while achieving target distributions across forest polygons.

## Key technical achievements:
	•	Monte Carlo Simulations: Conducted over 1,000 iterations to forecast species survival and establish optimal planting strategies.
	•	Markov Chains: Modeled interspecies transitions and competition dynamics to determine the best planting sequence.
	•	Mathematical Model: The objective function minimized overall competition in a forest polygon, ensuring optimal species coexistence.
	•	Python Implementation: Utilized libraries like NumPy and custom algorithms to process large data sets and solve the optimization problem.
 
This project provided valuable insights into applying stochastic processes and simulation techniques to real-world environmental challenges.
